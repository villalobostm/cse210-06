Final Project

# El pong Game
Pong was originally released in 1972 by Atari, we decided to recreate our improved version of the game by adding more difficulty to the game.

# Rules
- Player 1 moves with the keyboards “w” up and “s” down.
- Player 2 moves with the keyboards “up” up and “down” down.
- The ball randomly bounces to one side and the player uses a paddle to kick the ball to the other side. Player scores if the opponent does not hit the ball.
- The first to 11 points is declared the winner.
- If the points are tied at 10-10, a player then must strive for a two-point lead to win the game.
